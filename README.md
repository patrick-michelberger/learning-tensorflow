# Learning TensorFlow

This repository provides code and exercises for learning TensorFlow and is meant to serve as a personal learning tool.

## Overview

TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation, particularly large-scale machine learning. The basic principle is simple: you first define a computational graph in Python and then TensorFlow runs it efficiently using optimized C++

## Installation

First activate your favorite isolated environment e.g. virtualenv or anaconda.

```
$ source activate tensorflow
```

Next intall TensorFlow

```
$ pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```

Test your Installation

```
$ python -c 'import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)'
1.0.0
```
